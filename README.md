ML Model for PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS

Predictive Analysis of Academic Achievements leverages variables such as age, gender, ethnicity, parental education, and study habits (e.g., weekly study time, absences, tutoring) to forecast student performance. Factors like parental support, extracurriculars, sports, music, and volunteering provide insights into overall development. GPA and grade class serve as performance benchmarks, helping create models that identify patterns to support academic success and targeted interventions.
